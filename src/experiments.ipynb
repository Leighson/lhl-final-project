    "\n",
    "In the classic implementation,these region proposals were used to extract output features from a pre-trained CNN and then were fed into an SVM for final classification. In this implementation, the location from the regional proposal was treated as the bounding box, while the SVM produced the class label for the bounding box region.\n",
